# Acceptance Tests for Jenkins

A project to flesh out some of the [manual test cases for Jenkins
LTS](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/LTS+RC+Testing) in an automated fashion.

Following areas are still worked on:

 * Vagrant-based `JenkinsController` implementations

## Getting Started

Let's start by running tests locally with `JENKINS_WAR=path/to/your/jenkins.war mvn test`.
This runs the entire test suite with the specified Jenkins war and Firefox, so it will take a while.

Set `BROWSER=chrome` and install http://code.google.com/p/chromedriver/downloads/list in `$PATH` if desired. (But tests may fail.)

There is a bit of a delay since we bring up Jenkins for every single test, with
it's own sandboxed workspace.

All executed tests are screen recorded by default, but only videos of failing tests are persited to `target` directory.
By default, video file is named with the fully qualified test class name, minus sign (-) and the test method name.

You can configure what is persisted by using an environment variable or a Java system property called `RECORDER`.
Possible values are:

* off
* failuresOnly
* always

Java system property takes precedence over environment variable.
