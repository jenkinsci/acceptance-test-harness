 * Due to the nature of the harness, the framework is full of timeouts waiting for things to happen. Given the number of
 * modes of execution, environments and configurations there is, there are no right timeouts to balance the desire to
 * abort operations that takes too long and necessity not to interrupt operations taking a bit more time to complete
 * successfully.
 * <p>
 * To reflect that, use {@code -DElasticTime.factor} and configure the factor to slow down / speed up the measured time
 * for your executions. Floating point values are accepted too.
