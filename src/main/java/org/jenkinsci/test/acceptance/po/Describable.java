/**
 * Annotation used to register implementations to be discovered automatically.

 * Note that different services creating an instances have different conventions concerning both the values of this
 * annotation as well as the class interface. In some cases, descriptions are visual labels used in UI, but it can as
 * well be an internal identifier such as Jenkins class name. Compare {@link Describable} annotations for {@link
 * MatrixProject} and {@link ShellBuildStep}. Unique constructor signature is often required for implementations of the
 * same abstraction.
 * <p>
 * The details should be documented in particular superclass, such as {@link Job} or {@link BuildStep}.
